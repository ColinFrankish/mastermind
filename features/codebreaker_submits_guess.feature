Feature: code-breaker submits guess
  
  The code-breaker submits a guess of four colored
  pegs. The mastermind game marks the guess with black
  and white "marker" pegs.
  For each peg in the guess that matches color
  and position of a peg in the secret code, the
  mark includes one black peg. For each additional
  peg in the guess that matches the color but not
  the position of a color in the secret code, a white
  peg is added to the mark.
